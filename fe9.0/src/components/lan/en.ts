If the temperature stays high overnight, the maximum will be reached earlier the following day and will last longer. When unusually high night and daytime temperatures persist, heat stress becomes a critical factor in human health and whether infrastructure functions properly. In heatwaves, hot nights make it harder to recover from the heat of the day and this puts more stress on the body.",

When the land becomes saturated, the excess water flows into river systems and can caused them to exceed their capacity. This causes the water the flow into the low-lying areas adjacent.",
          "Flash floods can occur almost anywhere from short intense bursts of rainfall, making them one of the most dangerous forms of flooding. They can be particularly problematic in urban areas where the drainage system cannot cope with the amount of water. As the water rises quickly, flash floods can be difficult to warn of.",
          "Coastal floods happen when a low-pressure system or strong onshore winds force sea levels to rise above normal levels, creating a storm surge that can cause flooding of low-lying areas close to tidal waterways and foreshores",

Your location will determine whether you are likely to experience river, flash or costal flooding or a combination of several of these types of flood risks.",
          "Riverine flooding occurs in relatively low-lying areas adjacent to streams and rivers. In the extensive flat inland regions of Australia, floods may spread over thousands of square kilometres and last several weeks, with flood warnings sometimes issued months in advance. In the mountain and coastal regions of Australia, flooding can happen rapidly with a warning of only a few hours in some cases.",
          "Flash flooding, otherwise known as overland flooding, can occur almost anywhere there is a relatively short, intense burst of rainfall such as during a thunderstorm. As a result, the drainage system has insufficient capacity or time to cope with the downpour. Although flash floods are generally localised, they pose a significant threat because of their unpredictability and normally short duration.",

The immediate impacts of flooding include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops and loss of livestock. The ongoing emotional impact is substantial with increased emotional stress and physical illness from waterborne diseases. Floods also frequently damage power transmission and sometimes power generation, which then has knock-on effects caused by the loss of power.",

Inspect your home for damage carefully using a flashlight (not candles to avoid a fire hazard), and document any damage for insurance claims. Be cautious of residual dangers like contaminated water, damaged electrical systems, and displaced wildlife.",
